# ATM Card Flip Animation

This project is a simple yet elegant animation effect for an ATM card that flips 180 degrees to reveal its back side. This animation is built purely with HTML and CSS, providing a visually appealing and interactive way to display both the front and back of the card.

## Project Features

- **180-degree Flip Animation**: The ATM card flips horizontally, displaying the front and back sides when hovered over.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to look good on various screen sizes.
- **Pure HTML & CSS**: Created without any JavaScript, making it lightweight and fast to load.

## Demo

[Include a link to a live demo or GIF showing the animation]

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To structure the content of the card (front and back details).
- **CSS**: For styling and animation effects.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The card has two main parts - the front and back sections, each containing relevant information (such as cardholder name, card number, expiry date, and CVV).
2. **CSS Flip Animation**: Using CSS `transform` and `transition` properties, the card rotates 180 degrees along the Y-axis when hovered, revealing the back side.
